  <h2>html이란 무엇인가?</h2>
  <br>The lumbar stabilization exercise program includes a range of exercises that typically progress from beginning to more advanced:
  <p>From static (lying) to dynamic (standing or jumping)
  From resisting gravity to resisting additional outside force
  From predictable to unpredictable movements
  From individual components of a movement to the complete range of motion in a movement
  At all times the neutral spine position is maintained. Progression to the next exercise generally depends on learning to maintain the neutral spine properly during the current exercise. The physical therapist or exercise therapist is trained to help the patient learn the proper technique.</p>
